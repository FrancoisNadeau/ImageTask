# mTask

### To run this you'll need to download, install and import the latest version of Psychopy
### All three '500_xxxxxxx' folders should also be in the same directory as mTask.py, except the '500_face' folder, which is not yet fully operational.
### The experiment actually shows 12 unique images and a target instead of 14 unique and a target to prevent needing to download any more heavy category image folder.
