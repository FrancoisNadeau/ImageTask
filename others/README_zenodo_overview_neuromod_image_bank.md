## Notice

#### All images found in the bank were collected under the terms of Creative Commons licenses and should theoretically be copyright-free and reusable with modification. However, if you are the owner of an image and wish for a more detailed attribution or for us to remove your picture from the image bank, feel free to write at neuromod.imagebank@gmail.com (please insert proof of ownership in your message). The images gathered in this bank are meant to be used for brain imaging at Dr. Pierre Bellec's SIMEXP Lab, CRIUGM, Montreal. As an open-source lab, we strongly encourage collaboration  between labs by sharing results and data. It would be greatly appreciated from the image bank users to share their neuro-imaging work with us, and we'd be happy to return the favor.
